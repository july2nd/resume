%{Startup Project}{}
%{
%The Yueying app is a social application based on LBS, aimed at offering people opportunities to make friends by seeing films together. I have been working as a technicist in Yueying studio, and responsible for designing and implementing most functions of the back-end server and a few front-end development, including purchasing server, server configuration, GPS location etc.

%{Taxi recommender}
%{}
%{Competition Project}{}
%{
%This competition was organized by Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), China Computer Federation (CCF) and Chongqing Municipal People’s Government. Our task was to predict the probability and waiting time of the potential passengers who are waiting for a vacant taxi, given the passengers’ current positions. We proposed a model to serve the passengers by mining the historical GPS data of taxis in Beijing. I acted as the vice team leader and worked on the mathematical modeling and program development. Key technologies include traffic flow modeling, Hadoop, HBase, Google map. Finally our team won the 3rdPrize(top17 of 660 teams).
